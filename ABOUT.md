## Inspiration

**The Problem**

When learning a new language, you need vocabulary apps, translation tools, and reading platforms‚Äîbut they're all separate. You copy-paste text between apps, lose context, and break your natural learning flow. There's no single tool that lets you learn naturally while browsing real content.

**The Solution**

Linguine transforms any webpage into an interactive language learning experience. Learn vocabulary from real articles, understand complex texts through AI simplification, and review what you've learned‚Äîall without leaving your browser. Every webpage becomes a learning opportunity with one click.

**Why This Matters**

Languages are learned through context, not isolated vocabulary lists. Linguine bridges the gap between learning apps and real-world language use, enabling you to learn exactly how you encounter language in daily life‚Äîwhile reading news, blogs, or any webpage you visit.

## What it does

Linguine is a Chrome extension that transforms web browsing into language learning. It uses Chrome's Built-in AI to provide translations, text simplification, and vocabulary tracking‚Äîall running on your device with complete privacy.

### How It Works: Two Learning Loops

**Vocabulary Learning Loop** (Learn Words ‚Üí Remember Words)
1. **Browse** any webpage in your target language
2. **Discover** unfamiliar words naturally in context
3. **Add** words to your personal vocabulary database (one click)
4. **Review** words using ANKI-style flashcards with spaced repetition
5. **Master** words through consistent practice

**Example**: Reading a French news article ‚Üí seeing "bonjour" in context ‚Üí adding it to vocabulary ‚Üí reviewing it later ‚Üí mastering it through flashcards.

**Comprehension Learning Loop** (Understand Complex Texts ‚Üí Build Confidence)
1. **Encounter** complex text while browsing
2. **Simplify** text using AI to make it more accessible
3. **Save** simplified versions with source links
4. **Return** to original text with better understanding

**Example**: Finding a difficult Spanish article ‚Üí simplifying complex sentences ‚Üí saving for later ‚Üí returning to original text with confidence.

**How They Work Together**: Words you learn help you understand more complex texts. Texts you simplify provide clearer context for vocabulary words. Both loops accelerate each other.

### Chrome Built-in AI APIs Used

- **Prompt API (LanguageModel)**: Generates contextual translations, example sentences for flashcards, and analyzes vocabulary progress
- **Translator API**: Provides fast, literal word-by-word translations in Reading Mode
- **Rewriter API**: Simplifies complex text to make it more accessible for learners
- **LanguageDetector API**: Automatically detects webpage language for seamless experience

## How we built it

**Architecture**: Four-layer system that keeps data local and secure
- **UI Layer**: React components for popup, side panel, and Reading Mode
- **API Layer**: Type-safe interfaces with Zod validation
- **Background Layer**: Offscreen document for database access
- **Database Layer**: SQLite stored locally via OPFS (survives browser restarts)

**Tech Stack**: React + TypeScript, Vite, Turborepo, SQLite (OPFS), Zod validation

**Key Technical Decisions**

1. **Offscreen Document for Database**: Chrome extensions need special handling to store data locally. We use an offscreen document to access SQLite via OPFS, ensuring your vocabulary and rewrites persist even after closing Chrome.

2. **Progressive Streaming**: Reading Mode shows text immediately, then loads translations in the background. This means no waiting‚Äîyou can start reading while translations appear smoothly.

3. **Multi-Language Word Segmentation**: Different languages need different approaches. We use modern JavaScript for most languages, special libraries for Thai, and smart fallbacks for everything else.

4. **Visual Vocabulary Feedback**: Words are color-coded based on your knowledge level. Red words you don't know, green words you've learned. This instant visual feedback accelerates learning.

5. **Privacy-First Architecture**: All AI processing happens on your device using Chrome's built-in AI. No data is sent to external servers, enabling offline use and complete privacy.

## Challenges we ran into

**Storing Data Locally in Chrome Extensions**
Challenge: Chrome's background scripts can't directly access local file storage. We needed a way to store vocabulary and rewrites permanently.
Solution: Implemented offscreen document pattern‚Äîa hidden page that can access local storage and communicate with the extension.

**Making AI Fast and Non-Blocking**
Challenge: AI translations can be slow. We didn't want users waiting with blank screens.
Solution: Built progressive streaming‚Äîdisplay text instantly, load translations in the background. Users see content immediately while AI processes in parallel.

**Handling Different Languages**
Challenge: Thai doesn't use spaces between words. Japanese uses three writing systems. Each language needs different segmentation.
Solution: Built language-specific strategies with smart fallbacks. Works for any language, with special handling for unique cases.

**Keeping Everything Synchronized**
Challenge: Extension has multiple parts (popup, side panel, content scripts) that need to stay in sync.
Solution: Created reactive storage system with live updates. Change vocabulary in side panel, see it update everywhere instantly.

**Chrome AI API Requirements**
Challenge: Chrome's AI APIs need user interactions (clicks) to work, especially for initial model downloads.
Solution: Designed UI so all AI operations are triggered by explicit user actions, with clear feedback about what's happening.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of

‚úÖ **Complete Privacy**: Zero data leaves your browser. Everything runs client-side using Chrome's built-in AI. No tracking, no external services, no subscriptions.

‚úÖ **Works Offline**: After initial setup, everything works without internet. Your vocabulary, rewrites, and reviews are all stored locally and accessible offline.

‚úÖ **Real Multi-Language Support**: Not just European languages‚Äîwe support Thai (no word boundaries), Japanese (three writing systems), and six diverse languages total, each with unique challenges.

‚úÖ **Fast Performance**: Text appears instantly. Translations stream smoothly. No blocking, no waiting, no frozen screens.

‚úÖ **Seamless Integration**: Learn while you browse. No switching apps, no copy-pasting. Just click and learn from any webpage.

‚úÖ **Proven Learning Method**: ANKI-style spaced repetition is scientifically proven for memory retention. We've implemented it with 1-hour intervals for rapid learning.

‚úÖ **Four Chrome AI APIs Working Together**: We're not just using one API‚Äîwe're using Prompt API, Translator API, Rewriter API, and LanguageDetector API together seamlessly, showcasing the full potential of Chrome's built-in AI ecosystem.

## What we learned

**Building Chrome Extensions is Complex**
Multiple isolated contexts (popup, side panel, content scripts) need careful communication. Service workers have limitations. We learned to architect for Chrome's unique constraints while maintaining clean code.

**AI APIs Need Careful Handling**
Chrome's AI APIs are powerful but have requirements: user gestures, availability checks, graceful fallbacks. We learned to design UI around these constraints while keeping the experience smooth.

**Languages are Fascinatingly Different**
Thai segmentation is completely different from English. Japanese readability needs character-level analysis. We learned that one-size-fits-all doesn't work‚Äîeach language needs thoughtful, specific solutions.

**Users Value Privacy and Speed**
Privacy-first architecture wasn't just a technical decision‚Äîit became a core user benefit. Offline capability, instant feedback, and visual progress indicators matter more than feature lists.

**Type Safety Pays Off**
Using Zod for validation and TypeScript everywhere caught bugs early and made the codebase maintainable. Investing in developer experience improved code quality significantly.
